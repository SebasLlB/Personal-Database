# Personal-Database
This is my most ambitious and extensive project. I have created a personal database in which
I can store the many ideas for the many projects that I think over time. It utilizes a
NoSQL structure, powered by the MongoDB free framework. 

As of now, I can add ideas to multiple subcategories inside the database, called collections,
and also list all the title of all the projects stored in the collection selected.

With this in mind, it is still a rough work in progress, and I will only upload the complete
version. The testing version is more extensive, but is less thoroughly structured.

All my work has been guided by Youtube tutorials and MongoDB's "Getting Started with Mongodb
and Java - CRUD Operations Tutorial", which is a really extensive and easy-to-follow guide
on how to implement MongoDB's multiple features into a project.
